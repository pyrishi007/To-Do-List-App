# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple, responsive To-Do List app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to easily manage their tasks by adding, marking them as complete, and deleting them. The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## 🚀 Features

- **➕ Add tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **✅ Mark tasks as completed**: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status (strikes through the task).
- **❌ Delete tasks**: Users can remove tasks by clicking the "×" button next to them.
- **💾 Persistent data**: The tasks are saved to local storage, so they remain even after
